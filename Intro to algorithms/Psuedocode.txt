1. write the standard method of adding 2 positive integers, taught in primary school, as an algorithm.

start code
read a 
read b

result = a + b

print result
end code

2. write an algorithm that finds the second largest element among a, b and c.

start code
read a, b, c

middle = 0

if a > b AND a < c
	middle = a
if b > a AND b < c
	middle = b
if c > a AND c < b
	middle = c
if a < b AND a > c
	middle = a
if b < a AND b > c
	middle = b
if c < a AND c > b
	middle = c
print middle
end code
