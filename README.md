CWTM.py needs to be either converted to exe or needs to be ran in a compiler.
I personally recommend turning it into an Exe file through the use of things like pyinstaller.
The code is made to be ran from a usb but it can be modified to work from other places, at the end of the day its meant to be plugged in quickly, executed and plugged out.
The code requires an image called "Untitled9.png" (I will add an imaage randomiser later) to be put into the same usb, 
the image can be anything but in my case it was my little pony as a little inside joke.
I hope you enjoy the code and the pranks with it.
I'm also hoping to make it be able to run on MacOS and Linux in the future but for now it only works on windows.
